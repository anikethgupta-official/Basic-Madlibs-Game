## A Basic MadLibs Game (Java)

This is a simple **MadLibs Game** built using **Java**. The program takes different types of words (like nouns, verbs, and adjectives) as input and creates a fun, random story based on them!



## 💻What It Does

- Asks the user to input several words according to need of the program.
- Inserts them into a pre-written story template.
- Prints it into a final silly or surprising story.
- Provides the user with exclamations too.

It's a fun beginner project that helps practice **Java basics**, including:
- Variables and data types
- `Scanner` for input
- String concatenation
- Basic logic flow

and will be trying ot make more that can solve real life problems.
